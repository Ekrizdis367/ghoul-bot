# ghoul-bot
A Discord Bot for Vampire the Masquerade rule/information referencing.

Ghoul is a Vampire the Masquerade reference bot for querying 5e Corebook information quickly using Discord Commands.

You can query a list of possible commands using <strong>!ghoul</strong>

<strong>!d (discipline)</strong> | This command calls on a list of all powers under the provided discipline. <i>Ex: !d Obfuscate</i> <br>
<strong>!p (power)</strong> | This command provides relevant information on the power provided. <i>Ex: !p Shadow Cloak</i> <br>
<strong>!c (number)</strong> | This command provides information on the compulsion based on a provided dice roll number. <i>Ex: !c 2</i> <br>
<strong>!bp (number)</strong> | This command provides information on the blood potency table. <i>Ex: !bp 3</i> <br>
<strong>!disciplines</strong> | This command provides a list of the disciplines in alphabetical order. <br>
<strong>!compulsions</strong> | This command provides a list of the randomized compulsions and their die rolls. <br>
<strong>!social</strong> | This command provides a list of the social modifiers for countering social rolls. <br>

This is my first bot that I made to make a friend's VTM Server run more smoothly, and it was a hit with several people. It was suggested that I make it public, so here we are! Go easy!
